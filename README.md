# Good README Generator
    
     This project is an application that automatically creates a good README file.
     This has been tested only by me on my local pc.
     I, Scott H, am the only contributer to this project.
     The use case is for developers who want to create good easy README files.
     This application can be installed by downloading from my github account (500inthegraveyard) under the repo Node.js-andES6
